# Phase 2 compute infrastructure: service accounts and IAM for Dataproc
# Serverless (Spark + Sedona jobs that build the silver zone) and for dbt
# (which writes the gold zone in BigQuery).

# We do NOT provision a Dataproc Serverless batch resource here. Batches
# are submitted ad-hoc per Phase 2 ("manual gcloud invocation; no Airflow
# yet"). Terraform owns the durable principals; the submit command lives
# in scripts/.
